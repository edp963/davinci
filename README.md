## Introduction
Davinci is oriented towards product managers, business people, data engineers, data analysts, data scientists, etc. It aims to provide a one-stop data visualization solution, which could be both independently used as public cloud/private cloud and integrated into third-party systems as plugin. A simple configuration on Davinci UI can meet multiple visualization requirements. It also supports other visualization features like advanced interaction, industry analysis, pattern searching, social intelligence, etc.

## Design Philosophy
* Focus on two key concepts, data view (View in Davinci) and visual components (Widget in Davinci) 

  * Structural data is presented in Davinci View, from which all the logic, authorization and service are derived.
  * Visual data is presented in Davinci Widget, from which all the display, interaction and guidance are derived.
  * View and Widget supplement each other, providing users consistent experience and perception.
* Strengthen integration and customization capability as well as sharing and intelligence capability
  * Integration and customization capability means Davinci could seamlessly integrate into third-party systems and be customized,  combining with third-party systems.
  * Sharing and intelligence capability means users could share their dashboards with others, which stimulates them to improve the visualization ability both in aesthetic perception and technical skills.
  * In the field of data visualization, Davinci attaches great importance to basic interaction ability and various chart options; meanwhile, it lays more stress on integration and customization capability as well as sharing and intelligence capability.
